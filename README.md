# just a twitter bot

This is a simple tweet bot written in Python that I have running on a Raspberry Pi Zero. It currently is set up to tweet a joke every Friday via a cron job that executes the tweet.py file.

### Dependencies
- Requires a SQLITE3 Database (example included). You can either use the database sample provided (please put your own tweets in there). Or, alternatively you can use the sql provided and modify to suit your needs. Hell, do whatever the F you want, you will anyway.
- Expects a config.yml file with details from your twitter OAuth in order to connect to your account. If you can't figure this out feel free to ask me and I'll explain. I'll also recommend a course in Python because you can read the code and figure out what should be in there. Being a n00b is totally okay... just try a little m'kay?

### Assumptions
This is free software. I'll make updates when it suits me. Don't open issues because I assume if you have an issue, you will fix it yourself. Feel free to fork this project and modify to your heart's content.
